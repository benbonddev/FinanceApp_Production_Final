# Asset Placeholders

This directory contains placeholder files for the app assets. In a production environment, these would be replaced with actual image files.

- favicon.png - Web favicon (196x196)

## Asset Guidelines

- Use the app's primary color scheme
- Ensure all assets are properly sized for different devices
- Test on both iOS and Android devices
